# Comparison of Express.js with other Node.js frameworks
When it comes to building web applications using Node.js, there are several popular frameworks available in the market. Express.js is one of the most widely used Node.js frameworks, but it's not the only one. In this article, we'll take a look at how Express.js compares to some of the other popular Node.js frameworks.

## **Express.js**
Express.js is a minimalist web framework for Node.js that provides a simple, yet powerful set of features for web and mobile applications. Express.js is known for its flexibility, simplicity, and easy-to-use API, which makes it an excellent choice for developers who are just starting with Node.js.

Express.js is built on top of Node.js and provides features such as routing, middleware, and template engines. It's also very extensible, which means that you can add third-party middleware and plugins to enhance its functionality.

## Other Node.js frameworks
### **Koa.js**
Koa.js is a lightweight web framework for Node.js that is designed to be more expressive and flexible than Express.js. Koa.js uses async functions and generators, which makes it easier to write asynchronous code. It also provides a cleaner, more modular approach to middleware.

### **Nest.js**
Nest.js is a progressive Node.js framework for building scalable and efficient server-side applications. Nest.js provides a complete solution for building enterprise-grade applications, including features such as dependency injection, module organization, and testing utilities.

### **Sails.js**
Sails.js is a real-time MVC web framework for Node.js that provides a full-stack solution for building web applications. Sails.js is designed to make it easy to build real-time, scalable applications using Node.js. It also provides features such as database integration, authentication, and a built-in ORM.


## Conclusion
In conclusion, there are several popular Node.js frameworks available, and each one has its strengths and weaknesses. Express.js is a great choice for developers who are just starting with Node.js and want a simple, flexible framework. Koa.js is an excellent choice for developers who want a more expressive and flexible framework. Nest.js is a great choice for developers who are building large-scale enterprise-grade applications. And Sails.js is a good choice for developers who want a full-stack solution for building real-time web applications.
