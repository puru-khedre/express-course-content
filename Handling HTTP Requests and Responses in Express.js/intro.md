<!-- Handling HTTP Requests and Responses in Express.js -->
# Introduction to this Lesson
In the previous lesson, we learned how to set up and get started with Express.js. Now, in this lesson, we will learn how to handle HTTP requests and responses in an Express.js application.

Understanding how HTTP requests and responses work is an essential aspect of building web applications. HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and it is the underlying protocol that powers the World Wide Web. RESTful APIs are a widely used architectural style that relies on HTTP and its request/response model.

In this lesson, we will explore the basics of HTTP and RESTful APIs, learn how to handle GET and POST requests in Express.js, and understand how to send JSON and HTML responses from an Express.js application.

By the end of this lesson, you will have a strong understanding of how to handle HTTP requests and responses in Express.js, which will be essential for building web applications that interact with the outside world.
