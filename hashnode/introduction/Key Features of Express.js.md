# Key Features of Express.js

Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js, and it comes with several features that make it ideal for building web applications and APIs. In this article, we'll explore some of the key features of Express.js that make it a favorite among developers.

## [Routing](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)

Express.js provides a robust and flexible routing system that makes it easy to handle different HTTP requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. You can define multiple routes that match different URL patterns, and each route can be associated with a specific behavior, such as rendering a view, returning JSON or text, or redirecting to another URL.

## [Middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html)

Middleware functions in Express.js are functions that execute some behavior before or after a request is processed. Express.js provides a lot of built-in middleware functions, such as body-parser for parsing request bodies, morgan for logging HTTP requests, and cookie-parser for handling cookies. Developers can also create their own middleware functions for handling custom behavior.

## Views

Express.js provides a way to render dynamic HTML pages using templating engines such as Pug, EJS, and Mustache. Templating engines allow developers to create reusable templates that are populated with data at runtime, and the resulting HTML pages are sent to the client's browser. Express.js makes it easy to use different templating engines and to pass data to views.

## [Error Handling](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/error-handling.html)

Express.js has a built-in error-handling middleware function that makes it easy to handle errors in a structured way. By defining a middleware function that takes four arguments (err, req, res, and next), developers can catch errors thrown by other middleware functions and handle them appropriately. This feature helps to ensure that errors don't crash the application and provides a way to log or display error messages to the user.

## Static Files

Express.js can serve static files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from a specified directory. This feature is helpful for serving files that don't require any processing or dynamic behavior, such as images, fonts, or client-side JavaScript libraries. Express.js also provides a built-in middleware function called express.static that makes it easy to serve static files.

## Conclusion

Express.js is a powerful web application framework for Node.js that provides several key features for building web applications and APIs. These features include routing, middleware, views, error handling, and static files. By leveraging these features, developers can quickly build scalable and maintainable web applications that meet their business needs. If you're new to Express.js, it's recommended that you start with the official documentation and try out some sample applications to get a feel for how Express.js works.
