## Introduction

If you're new to the world of web development, you might have heard of both Express.js and Node.js. And you may be wondering: What's the difference between the two? In this article, we'll provide an overview of both technologies and explain how they differ from each other.

## Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to write server-side applications using JavaScript. Created by Ryan Dahl, Node.js was first released in 2009 and has quickly become a popular technology for building server-side applications.

Node.js is built on top of the Google V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same engine used by Google Chrome to execute JavaScript code. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it scalable and efficient for handling a large number of concurrent connections.

## Express.js

[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) is a web application framework for Node.js. It was created by TJ Holowaychuk in 2010 and has become one of the most popular Node.js frameworks.

Express.js provides a minimal, flexible, and robust set of features for building web applications and APIs. It provides a wide range of features, including routing, middleware, templating, database integration, and authentication, making it easy for developers to build complex web applications quickly.

## What's the difference?

The main difference between Node.js and Express.js is that Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code, while Express.js is a web application framework built on top of Node.js. In other words, Node.js provides the runtime for executing JavaScript code on the server-side, while Express.js provides a set of tools and features for building web applications and APIs.

Node.js is a low-level platform that provides a lot of flexibility for developers who want to build server-side applications using JavaScript. It provides a set of core modules for building network applications, file systems, streams, and other functionalities. However, building web applications from scratch using only Node.js can be challenging and time-consuming.

Express.js, on the other hand, provides a lot of tools and features that make it easy to build web applications quickly. It provides a set of APIs for handling HTTP requests and responses, routing, middleware, templating, and database integration. Express.js makes it easy to build complex web applications by providing a set of conventions and best practices for building web applications.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, both Node.js and Express.js are important tools for building server-side applications using JavaScript. While Node.js provides the runtime for executing JavaScript code, Express.js provides a set of tools and features for building web applications and APIs quickly. If you're looking to build a web application using Node.js, it's highly recommended that you use a framework like Express.js to make your development process faster and more efficient.
