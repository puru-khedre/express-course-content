# Setting up your development environment
To build server-side web applications using Express, the first step is to set up your development environment. In this article, we will guide you through the process of setting up your development environment.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Yarn

## Step 1: Install Node.js
The first step is to install Node.js on your computer. You can download Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and follow the instructions to install it. Node.js comes bundled with npm, but in this guide, we will be using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as our package manager.

## Step 2: Install Yarn
After installing Node.js, you can install Yarn by running the following command in your terminal.

```
npm install -g yarn
```

This command will install Yarn globally on your computer.

## Step 3: Create a new Express project
To create a new Express project, open your terminal and run the following command:

```
mkdir my-express-app
cd my-express-app
yarn init -y
```

This will create a new directory for your project, move into it, and initialize a new project with Yarn.

## Step 4: Install Express
After creating the project, you can install the Express module by running the following command in your terminal:

```
yarn add express
```

This will add Express to your project as a dependency.

## Step 5: Create an index.js file
Next, you'll create an `index.js` file with the following code:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(1337, () => {
  console.log('Listening on port 1337!');
});
```

This code sets up a basic server with Express that listens on port 1337 and responds with "Hello, World!" when you visit `http://localhost:1337/` in your web browser.

 ## Step 6: Run the application 
 Finally, start the Express server by running the following command in your terminal:

```
node index.js
```

This will start the server and output a message in your terminal that says "Listening on port 1337!".

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:1337/` to see the "Hello, World!" message displayed.

## Conclusion
Setting up your development environment to build server-side web applications using Express with Yarn as your package manager is a simple and straightforward process. You only need to install Node.js and Yarn, create a new Express project, install Express, and create an `index.js` file to get started. Once you've completed these steps, you can run your server and start building your web applications.
